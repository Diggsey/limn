This crate contains layout code taken from Conrod, modified to use limn's coordinate system and broken into separate files.

Code is very messy and likely broken in many places.

Long term, this should potentially be cleaned up, published and shared with conrod.
Alternately, the minimal layout code in rusttype could be extended with this functionality, either within rusttype, or in a rusttype_layout crate.
